Webapp meant to track my cat's weight loss. He's a chunky boy, so fingers crossed this works.
This is a project written using [Amber](https://amberframework.org) and Crystal.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of this project running on your machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

This project requires [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) ([installation guide](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/)).

## Development

To start your Amber server:

1. Install dependencies with `shards install`
2. Build executables with `shards build`
3. Create and migrate your database with `bin/amber db create migrate`. Also see [creating the database](https://docs.amberframework.org/amber/guides/create-new-app#creating-the-database).

Now you can visit http://localhost:3000/ from your browser.
